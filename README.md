Linux-Application-Device-Drivers-for-Bluetoooth-GPRS-WiFi-functionalities.
=====================================================================

The Linux application device drivers for Bluetooth, WI-Fi and GPRS engines running on an Embedded-Linux ported controller.

In specific to the project, we tested the drivers by interfacing SIM908, a GPRS-GSM-GPS module and a Bluetooth HCI module to an ARM CORTEX-M3 based dual-core controller LPC1788.

The idea was to develop a set of application drivers that could compile on any Linux-based-platform, which enables any Linux-based-controller to easily interface with GPRS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth engines irrspective of the corresponding module configurations.
